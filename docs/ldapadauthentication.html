											<p>To enable the optional LDAP/AD authentication module, set the <em>eloquent-ldap.enabled</em> variable to <em>true</em> in the <em>.env</em>
											file as shown below:</p>

											<pre><code>eloquent-ldap.enabled=true</code></pre>

											<p>By default, the LDAP/AD authentication module is set to off or false, as it requires some extra configuration on your part.
											For more information on how to configure the module, refer to the documentation of the underlying package at
											<a href="https://github.com/sroutier/eloquent-ldap">sroutier/eloquent-ldap</a>. Additionally, every option is explained in the config file
											<em>/config/eloquent-ldap.php</em>.</p>

											<P>With the LDAP/AD integration enabled, a few features are added:</P>

											<ul>
												<li>Automatically creates local accounts for LDAP/AD users during initial login.</li>
												<li>Automatic assignment of users to local roles based on matching LDAP/AD group membership.</li>
												<li>Automatically refresh role assignment on user login.</li>
											</ul>
