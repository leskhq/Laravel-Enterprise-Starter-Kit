											<p>To enable LERN (Laravel Exception Recorder and Notifier) set the configuration option as shown below:</p>

											<pre><code>LERN.ENABLED=false</code></pre>

											<p>Once enabled, LERN can record exceptions in the table <code>lern_exceptions</code> as well as email them if your mail system is properly
											configured. A few more options are available to tweak the behaviour of LERN, refer to the <code>lern.php</code> configuration page and the project home page at <a href="https://github.com/tylercd100/lern">tylercd100/lern</a>.
											All recorded exceptions can be seen in the <em>Error</em> page from the <em>Admin</em> menu. Individual exceptions also can be reviewed and should the need arise, old entries can be deleted with the purge button. The setting <code>ERRORS_PURGE_RETENTION</code> let you configure how
											far back, in days, exceptions are kept when purging. By default, any exception older than <code>30</code> days is deleted.</p>
