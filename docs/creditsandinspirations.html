                                            <p>It goes without saying that none of this could have been done without the great <a href="http://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a>
                                            framework, a big thank you goes out to <a href="http://taylorotwell.com/" target="_blank">Taylor Otwell</a> and the hundreds of volunteers
                                            of the Laravel &amp; Open Source community.</p>

                                            <p>I would like to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way" target="_blank">Jeffrey Way</a> for the excellent <a href="https://laracasts.com/" target="_blank">Laracast</a>
                                            a never ending source of knowledge.</p>

                                            <p>Additionally, credit goes out to the authors of the various components and modules, noted in the sections above, used
                                            as part of this project.</p>

                                            <p>Finally, I would like to point to a number of projects that served as inspiration and great sources of learning material.
                                            These projects are similar to the LESK but did not fully cover the requirements that we had. You may want to
                                            have a look at them:</p>
