											<p>Before deploying to a production or live server, you should take care of a few tasks.</p>

											<h3>Combine and minimise</h3>

											<p>Although not required, it may be helpful to combine and minimise both the CSS and JS files. Add any CSS and JS file
											that you may have added to the <em>styles</em> and <em>scripts</em> command (respectively) in the <em>gulpfile.js</em> and run the
											<em>gulp</em> command with the <em>--production</em> command line parameter to trigger the minimization process, as shown
											below:</p>

											<pre><code>gulp --production</code></pre>

											<h3>Review and encrypt settings</h3>

											<p>Carefully review the configuration of all settings and environment variables and consider encrypting the settings that may be sensitive. Settings can be encrypted via the web interface by checking the checkbox on the edit page of each setting or by using the artisan command. Remember to export and save to file all changed setting, encrypted or not.</p>
